The park is small and easy to navigate. There is a parade at 3pm, which may be shortened if it rains. Shopping is good and the hotel shuttle is a bit far away. Overall, it's a nice experience."
United Kingdom,0,"As HUGE Disney fans, this was one of the biggest draws in visiting Hong Kong. Unfortunately the park just seemed to be missing the magical Disney atmosphere of most Disney Parks. The castle is far too small (but I believe there are plans for it being improved), there is no area for shows infront of it. The cast members were not as happy and bubbily as with other parks. The park has all the traditional areas and the rides are whole family friendly. We also booked a Private Tour through the park website which was amazing. Dani, our host, spoke fantastic English and was able to restore that Disney feeling that had been missing. The private tour makes you feel like a rockstar as you get to queue jump on most of the rides and get reserved seating in shows. Would definitely recommend anyone to do this.","Simplify ""As HUGE Disney fans, this was one of the biggest draws in visiting Hong Kong.

They found the park to be missing the magical atmosphere of other Disney Parks, and the castle to be too small.

United Kingdom,0,"You are never too old to enjoy the wonders of Walt Disney. However, Hong Kong Disneyland does seem to cater for a younger and less thrill seeking visitor so for those wanting big rides and thrills at every turn then this may not be the place for you. Only purchase a one day pass as this place can be easily done in half a day and remember that the weather is hot and humid so beware! The queues are relatively small, in fact we walked straight to the front on nearly every ride but I would suggest getting there at open time to avoid any queues but more importantly, avoid the temperatures. Make sure you check out the times for meeting the characters. We were rather surprised by how accommodating the characters were in the sense that they spent a lot of time with each visitor or family and happily posed for numerous phones and cameras and various poses. We would suggest getting in the queues for the characters at least 10 minutes before but the queues for Minnie and Mickey are long so get there early!","Simplify ""You are never too old to enjoy the wonders of Walt Disney.

Purchase a one-day pass, as the park can be done in half a day. Keep in mind that the weather is hot and humid. The lines for rides are usually short, but it's best to arrive at opening time to avoid queues and the heat. Don't miss the character meet-and-greet times, but be prepared for long lines for Minnie and Mickey. Arrive at least 10 minutes before the meet-and-greet time to avoid long waits."

United Kingdom,0,"As a cynic, I was sceptical about getting excited about meeting Mickey and Minnie Mouse. Nevertheless, I figured that Disneyland would probably be a hit with the kids (3 and 7 yrs). It was busy but the queues were reasonable. Longest time spent queuing for an attraction was 45 mins (lion king performance). The lion king and Mickey Mouse shows were amazing. My little one totally believed the cast were real and was so excited. The singing, the stage, the interactive play were all entertaining. My cynicism about Disneyland melted away immediately and totally got into all the hype. The atmosphere was very friendly. Only downside was the food. Lots of choice but pricey and not the best quality. Must see the day and night parade. Both as good as each other. Didn't disappoint. The fireworks at the end of the night finished off an enjoyable visit nicely. Best place to see the fireworks is in front of the Disney castle. Would recommend...

So when I came for a second visit I decided to try Disneyland as I hadn't been before.Not first of all being a 30 year old male I know I'm not really in the Disney target market, but I had a great time at their parks in Orlando, so was hoping for a similar experience here.I would say there is only 1 real thrill ride, which is the Runaway Mine Train. Everything else is definitely targeted at children and kids. The parade was ok, but nothing like as spectacular as the one in Orlando. Likewise the fireworks display at the end of the day was fairly average.The Lion King stage show was really good (I even went back twice) and I liked the fact you were allowed to take photos.

Of all the Disneylands I have been to this is probably the smallest of all, not quite designed for the western taste, there are very few rides, most of the attractions are just 'photo opportunities' that chinese people love and westernes and not so bothered about. On a quiet day you can ride all the rides at least once some even twice. The park is clean and the staff pleasant. All the queue areas are sheltered to protect people from the sun and rain. Some of the queue areas have ventilators that are much appreciated in thoses hot Hong Kong summer days. The restaurants terrible like all restaurants at all Disneyland resorts I've ever visited. And not cheap. You are much better off bringing your own food. The only thing worth eating are the mickey mouse waffles that they sell on the cafe at the main street, but if you buy one of those, I don't recommend that you sit on the tables at the back of the place to eat it, because it's full of very aggressive birds that steal the food and attack the children. I usually buy the waffle and eat it on one of the benches on the main street. The shops are quite cheap and the quality of the toys is very good, the t shirts are a bit so so. The only problem with the shop is that the clothes are tailored to the chinese taste so if you are a Westener you may struggle to find things that would want to wear and fit because of lack of large sizes.","Simplify ""I know this park very well because I have been a season pass holder for two years.

The train itself has Mickey head shaped windows which everyone loved. Inside there are comfortable seats and small statues of the Disney figures.

This park is only 10 years old so the rides are still new and shiny compared to the dated ones you get in Orlando. The shows are good, could do with more English subtitles but this didn't matter too much as the acting and singing was in English, definitely see the festival of the lion king. The paint the night parade was also good, one of my favourite parts of the park was how much Disney Pixar I saw about and more of the old classic films and princesses. Definitely worth a visit! ""","The person had a relaxed and enjoyable day at a Disneyland park that is less crowded and has shorter lines than other Disney parks. The park is relatively new and the rides are newer and better maintained than those at other parks. The shows are good, but could have more English subtitles. The person recommends seeing the ""Festival of the Lion King"" show and the ""Paint the Night"" parade, and notes the presence of Disney Pixar and classic films and princesses in the park.

United Kingdom,0,"I believe these days Disneyland is much quieter especially as they're currently building one in Shanghai. To be honest I'm glad, the longest we had to wait for a ride or attraction (apart from meeting Mickey Mouse) was 20 mins.It's well connected to Knowloon and Central with the MTR connection at Sandy Bay, and really cheap too. About   2.50 one way. There's a short walk from the station to the main gate. I recommend buying your tickets online in advance, we were able to walk right up to the turnstiles without queuing up for tickets and go straight through. Sleeping Beauty's castle is much smaller than I expected, I don't know what the other parks are like but I kind of hoped you could go in.There's lots of restaurants and plenty of choices for food western or Chinese again for a reasonable price. I was a bit disappointed with the  haunted house  nothing more than loud noises and fast motion. You get put in a car and shoved around in all directions. I went with my one year old and three year old they loved it! There wasn't too many over 4ft rides they both loved the it's a small world ride.

United Kingdom,0,"Disneyland Hong Kong.My husband and I visited Disney on a Sunday; the whole of Hong Kong must have been there. Starting with the Disney Mtr, there where queues.The Disney touch started on the MTR with Mickey shaped windows and brass effect Disney characters in glass domes.

A short walk along the street and you see the Sleeping Beauty Castle and the road leading to the different lands. The park has all the old favourites, Small World, Space Mountain, Mad Hatters Teapots etc.The new land Grizzly Gulch has just opened, its very small but has a good ride called Big Grizzly Mountain Runaway Mine Cars, which when we got there didn   t have a queue and we got on straight away, and we enjoyed the ride. We also enjoyed the jungle river cruise in Adventureland, and make sure you don   t miss Mickey   s Phihamagic the 3d adventure.Check the guide to find out the time of the parades and if you are not planning on watching all of it, make sure you are not around the route of the parade because you cannot get through the path way until it has passed.

United Kingdom,0,"Second ever visit to Hong Kong Disneyland. I am a hardcore Disney fan and went solo this time. Went on a Wednesday and there was not much of a queue for tickets at the door. There are cast members watching the queue and directing guests and weeding out queue jumpers! The park has been extended since the original 2006 plan but still you can easily do the whole park in one day by yourself. The park was not busy at all, and I hardly had to queue for anything, except shows and RC racer, which is very popular but has no fast pass. It is the best thrill ride in the park though, so an absolute must! Worth the queue! Space mountain and parachute drop have single rider queues that are very quick. Characters are plentiful, and I got to meet Beymax, which I was so excited about!The other highlights for me were the shows: Mickey's wondrous story book and the Lion King: outstanding performances!!! Definitely make sure you get to see them! For me both shows were not full at all, but make sure you arrive at least ten minutes before show time because they close the doors before the actual show time.Lastly, the parades were cancelled due to bad weather, but HK Disneyland did not disappoint its guests and put out the 'Rainy day parade' with the princesses, Toy story characters and the main gang  with their special raincoats! Jolly good show!The Disney Magic is well and truly alive in Hong Kong! It's not super friendly bordering on cheese Florida nor does it have all the thrills of Paris, but it presents you with entertainment and attractions that the whole family can enjoy, and just as Walt Disney intended, everyone of all ages has a smile on their face : )","Simplify ""Second ever visit to Hong Kong Disneyland.

Therefore smaller parades as it isn't a permanent feature so not as much budget supplied? Still thoroughly enjoyed.""","The Disneyland Resort is smaller than some others, but still has the Disney magic. You can visit in one day, but spending two days is recommended for character meet-and-greets. The Lion King show is great and staying for the night parade and fireworks is recommended. During Halloween, the parades were themed and had only 4 floats, but it was still enjoyable."

Hong Kong, Paris, LA and Orlando.Had I not known it had been there for a decade I'd have sworn it was just opened and would eventually become much bigger.None of this was helped by most of Tomorrowland being closed off to allow for the Star Wars experience.The Disney Railroad was a train around the park and nothing else.The Castle felt tiny.Having been to all the western parks I was quite surprised by HK Disney's take on Big Thunder Mountain which is by far the best of any version in any western park. The Haunted Mansion alternative was also quite unique and though very clever I struggled to see a particular Disney connection, perhaps it will grown on me.A Small World is just better here, far more Disneyfied with recognisable characters from the movies.Do see the Lion King show, it is worth it for sure.In all, it's an OK park but can probably be done in half a day, a day tops unless it was particularly quiet when we were there because there really were no queues for anything.The train in is a lovely novelty, go that way if you can.

United Kingdom,0,"Went for a trip in March   and stayed at the nearby hotel. Maybe the smallest Disneyland in the world, but it felt more cosy and comfy.

It wasn't long before we were in the hotel itself and enjoying the comfy beds...Hey, but we're here to enjoy the attractions right? So, in no time at all, we all went around looking for the attractions. The hotel provided free coach services to the Disneyland itself, and am very glad that they catered for families with small ones using strollers etc. The kids were really excited the first evening we went out   and that excitement never really abated the 3 nights and four days we were there. All the rides and atttractions are as what you would expect, and never having the chance to see the original Disneyland, I guessed it was a lot smaller here in Hong Kong. Probably the only downside was how expensive meals were here. The prices are really high   but I guess that's how the make money. Still, it was quite a good thing for them to have halal food outlets here   with the number of visitors from the Middle East and Malaysia Indonesia   they would have lost a good proportion of possible income otherwise. Won't go in lengths about the attraction this time, just suffice to say they are there and made the kids really happy!

The staff are all really helpful and kind, they will take photos of you as a family   couple, it feels very safe and secure. Even if you are behaving like an over excited wally they'll just snap away and wish you a magical day7. The toilets are plentiful, clean, have western toilets and plenty of loo roll8. There are buggies for families to hire and these are just left outside the rides with all of the belongings on...It feels that safe. You can take your own pushchair.9. Most of the visitors seem to be from Asia and will spend most of their time on their phones and taking selfies (even if they have kids), the kids don't run wild but aren't as well supervised as they are in England perhaps. 10. There are lots of water fountains   spouts around that people use to refill bottles. We took water in and then refilled as required11. It's easy to get there on the mtr (subway   metro) and this is a really good way to arrive with a 5 minute walk to the park12. You can buy tickets in advance, we went on a Thursday, arrived at 10am and walked straight up to the counter (no queues), we went straight through to the park, the zones don't open until 10.30 so you have to stay on a shopping 'street' until then.

There are lots of characters around to meet, some have queues and others don't, these are really well done and great for big and little kids alike!15. Most of the rides we got on within 5 minutes of queueing throughout the day though it's definitely quieter between 10 and 12.30. The two exceptions were the autopia (not worth the wait) and the pooh ride, but you can use a priority ticket on these (everyone is entitled to 2 with standard tickets on certain rides), they tell you when to come back and you go straight in.

The queues are all in the shade (great for someone like me who burns easily) and there are things to see as you queue. The attention to detail throughout is phenomenal.17.

- Most rides have short wait times, except for Autopia and the Pooh ride, but you can use priority tickets for those. Queues are in the shade and have things to see while waiting.
- The best rides were Mystic Manor and Runaway Mine Cars in Guzzling Gulch, and the Space Roller Coaster.
- It's best to visit mid-week. The park is smaller than expected but delightful.
- The author would highly recommend this attraction."

United Kingdom,0,We had a fantastic time at Disneyland Hong Kong. It's what you come to expect from any Disney theme park! The rides are all fun and waiting times for most very manageable. HK Disney is significantly smaller than its Orlando counterpart so comfortably completed in a day without too much rush. The parades in the afternoon and evening were both great. We booked the meal package where you can select to eat lunch and dinner in a range of food courts and a snack from any of the vendors. Maybe saves you a few dollars but not the be all and end all. Tomorrowland and fantasyland both closed at 4:30 for their premium pass holders which is a shame. Why should regular customers miss out when we have paid good money to experience the whole park? The usual rude people that push and shove in queues and parades will get on your nerves but obviously not the park's doing. ,"Simplify ""We had a fantastic time at Disneyland Hong Kong.

Well, the one in Hong Kong must have the most exasperated parents on earth.The kids alternate between brief moments of joy and long bouts of boredom and frustration.I had expected Disneyland to be crowded and the queues long, but I was relatively hopeful that Disney's vaunted queue management systems and methods would help alleviate that. After all it's their core business. This wasn't much in evidence however. In Disneyland Hong Kong queue management appears to consist of telling the people queuing how much longer they have to wait. The information isn't even up to date. On the Slinky Dog ride in Toy Story Land I was handed a card with the time I'd joined the queue written on it. By the time I'd reached the front of the queue 40 minutes later, and the card was taken from me to record a 40 minute wait time, I'd hazard a guess that the people joining the back of the queue would probably have had to wait an hour.It's true that one can use FastPass, to book a later time and return. In the rides I managed to go on however, the FastPass queues were about a quarter to a third the length of the main queue, so that wasn't working either. It just delayed the main queue even more.Many rides were also not filled to capacity. On the Winnie the Pooh Hundred Acre Wood ride, my little family of three and an infant took up a car meant for six. On the Slinky Dog ride, an additional two adults could have squeezed into the car occupied by my three year old and myself. No wonder the queues are long.There were other irritations   turnstiles to exit some rides, for example. This just means that people pile up at the exits. The entrance to the Lion King theatre was packed with no queue management whatsoever, so when the doors opened, there was a headlong rush for seats. Perhaps the visitors aren't used to queuing, but Disney employees should set out queue lines, remind their guests of their obligations to others, and manage an orderly entrance.

United Kingdom,0,"We were in Hong Kong for 5 weeks and are Disney fans. We have been to both Disney parks in the USA and Paris many times. With a little research we had expected the park to be small, crowded because of the holidays, rude and queue jumping mainlanders and the weather to be hot. All these expectations were fulfilled.However, we did NOT expect to encounter rude CMs.We just entered Adventureland from Main Street where there is a stall to the right of the entrance. We wanted fast passes for the Lion King show and asked the girl at the store for directions, she pointed it out to us. Now the girl was not busy because there was no one else about, she was holding a little fan to her face which I don't blame her because of the heat but apparently they are not allowed to do this. Anyway because my children pin trade and she had a lanyard around her, I glanced at the pins on her lanyard. She immediately held up the lanyard but said in NOT a very friendly voice  Did you want to see this? Why don't you ask?! I feel embarassed if you look at me like that!!  Imagine my shock!! Now I'm a woman of 42 and with two kids in tow   why would she think I was staring at anything other than her lanyard?!!! I was so shocked by what she said and her attitude that I didn't know how to react, I just turned around and walked away. I really should have said something to her.Anyway, the more I thought about it the more uncomfortable I felt. She was really accusing me of doing something nasty. I went to City Hall and told a CM about my experience. The nasty CM's name was Mandy. The CM in City Hall was sympathetic but she did not write a report. She said that Mandy must be having a bad day, but I said that was no excuse to speak to a guest that way! She said she hoped the experience did not spoil my day but I said of course it had otherwise I would not be standing in front of her.I told her I met some CMs in Florida last summer where they were sent for training. I know that they are the lucky ones and that they cannot send everyone there to be trained. Maybe because of this I was expecting most of the CMs to be more like the ones in the other Disney Parks. Hong Kong Disneyland should train their CMs on better service attitude and also not to be afraid to speak to mainlanders when they are clearly queue jumping and acting in a non sociable manner. I saw an incident where a CM just let a mainlander queue jump.We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel the last two nights of our trip. The hotel is beautiful and the beds so comfortable. But we were in the pool on our last day and the lifeguards by the pool looked so bored. They have a slide and they have a lifeguard at the top of it. The slide has a red light and green light. Obviously when the light is on green you can slide down the water slide. Now although the lifeguard is there, I watched him and he was NOT looking whether we are going down when the light is on green or red, in fact he was not looking at us at all. There were young children in that queue. I was a little shocked by this.I will visit HK Disneyland again but not in the near future. I will return when there are more attractions and hope by then the mainlanders have learnt more social skills   they catch on very quickly. I did not see any spitting at all. And the CMs   maybe Disney should give them more training or pay them more.......","Simplify ""We were in Hong Kong for 5 weeks and are Disney fans.

All these expectations were fulfilled.However, we did NOT expect to encounter rude CMs.We just entered Adventureland from Main Street where there is a stall to the right of the entrance. We wanted fast passes for the Lion King show and asked the girl at the store for directions, she pointed it out to us. Now the girl was not busy because there was no one else about, she was holding a little fan to her face which I don't blame her because of the heat but apparently they are not allowed to do this. Anyway because my children pin trade and she had a lanyard around her, I glanced at the pins on her lanyard. She immediately held up the lanyard but said in NOT a very friendly voice  Did you want to see this? Why don't you ask?! I feel embarassed if you look at me like that!!  Imagine my shock!! Now I'm a woman of 42 and with two kids in tow   why would she think I was staring at anything other than her lanyard?!!! I was so shocked by what she said and her attitude that I didn't know how to react, I just turned around and walked away. I really should have said something to her.Anyway, the more I thought about it the more uncomfortable I felt. She was really accusing me of doing something nasty. I went to City Hall and told a CM about my experience. The nasty CM's name was Mandy. The CM in City Hall was sympathetic but she did not write a report. She said that Mandy must be having a bad day, but I said that was no excuse to speak to a guest that way! She said she hoped the experience did not spoil my day but I said of course it had otherwise I would not be standing in front of her.I told her I met some CMs in Florida last summer where they were sent for training. I know that they are the lucky ones and that they cannot send everyone there to be trained. Maybe because of this I was expecting most of the CMs to be more like the ones in the other Disney Parks. Hong Kong Disneyland should train their CMs on better service attitude and also not to be afraid to speak to mainlanders when they are clearly queue jumping and acting in a non sociable manner. I saw an incident where a CM just let a mainlander queue jump.We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel the last two nights of our trip. The hotel is beautiful and the beds so comfortable. But we were in the pool on our last day and the lifeguards by the pool looked so bored. They have a slide and they have a lifeguard at the top of it. The slide has a red light and green light. Obviously when the light is on green you can slide down the water slide. Now although the lifeguard is there, I watched him and he was NOT looking whether we are going down when the light is on green or red, in fact he was not looking at us at all. There were young children in that queue. I was a little shocked by this.I will visit HK Disneyland again but not in the near future. I will return when there are more attractions and hope by then the mainlanders have learnt more social skills   they catch on very quickly. I did not see any spitting at all. And the CMs   maybe Disney should give them more training or pay them more.......""","The writer visited Hong Kong Disneyland for 5 weeks as a Disney fan. They had expectations of the park being small, crowded, and having rude visitors and hot weather, which were all met. However, they were surprised by the rude attitude of a cast member (CM) they encountered, who accused the writer of staring at her lanyard. The writer reported the incident to City Hall, but the CM there was not helpful and the writer felt the experience spoiled their day. The writer also had concerns about the training of CMs, as they observed queue jumping and uninterested lifeguards at the pool. They plan to visit again in the future but only when there are more attractions and better social skills from mainland visitors. They also suggest that Disney could improve by providing more training or higher pay to CMs."

United States,1,"We are frequent visitors of Disney World and so opted to visit HK Disney while in HK for a different experience. The park is definitely smaller than WDW or even Disneyland in California. We went mid week in June and there were no lines.

United States,1,"When you think of Disney you think big, crowds, and busy! We visited Hong Kong Disneyland in the off season and I was surprised.

The park is about 1 2 the size of California's Magic Kingdom. For our experience with our toddler, the size of the park was just fine. Due to the size some of the rides that are in other Disneylands are not here but Hong Kong makes up with it by having other lands (i.e. Mystic Manor, Toy Story Land). (2) With the off season you will not have to wait. I think the longest we waited for a ride was about ten minutes which was fantastic. (3) The characters are there! I was really surprised how many character experiences there were throughout the park. (4) Easy shuttle from the hotel. We stayed at the Disneyland Hotel and we were able to shuffle my son back and forth in the park without any problems. (5) The operation times are different. I was really surprised that in March the park did not open until about 10:30 in the morning. Main Street was open but the rest of the park was not. (6) The prices  it's a Disney experience. Get ready to shell out big Hong Kong Dollars for anything. Its pretty much a once and a lifetime opportunity so live it up and go big or go home. (7) Don't fret if you use a restroom and come across a squatty potty  there are western toilets in there, you just have to look. :)","Simplify ""When you think of Disney you think big, crowds, and busy!

United States,1,If you are a Disney fan then you have to visit this park at least once.We were visiting Hong Kong and hadn't really planned on seeing the Disney park but on a whim we got on the subway and made our way here.One of the most fun things was the Subway ride. There is a dedicated car (complete with Micky Ears for windows) they built just for the park. Transportation is really easy   I wish they had something like this for the Disney parks in the US.The rides are very much like parks around the world so I won't go into that. However the interesting differences had to do with food and the crowds. Each restaurant had sample plates showing the food in little glass cases (nice touch) but I'll never get over the smell of the waffle  squid  that permeated the park. The locals love it but it honestly made me (American) gag. Other differences were carmel on the popcorn and curry fish balls in food carts.

Transportation is really easy   I wish they had something like this for the Disney parks in the US.The rides are very much like parks around the world so I won't go into that. However the interesting differences had to do with food and the crowds. Each restaurant had sample plates showing the food in little glass cases (nice touch) but I'll never get over the smell of the waffle  squid  that permeated the park. The locals love it but it honestly made me (American) gag. Other differences were carmel on the popcorn and curry fish balls in food carts.

The subway ride to the park was a highlight, as it was dedicated with Mickey ears. The park had similar rides to other Disney parks, but the food and crowds were different.

I recently had the chance to go back to Hong Kong and obviously HK Disneyland was at the top of my itinerary. My first international Disney! A momentous occasion. I'd heard many accounts about how it is a half day park but I knew I'd need more time to be able to appreciate all the details as well as get in some repeats. Soo, my sister and I decided to purchase two day tickets.We ran in there, highly anticipating our first glimpse of Sleeping Beauty castle but instead, stopped short when we saw what was ahead. A boxy, silly looking refurb facade. Sigh. It was the most unmagical moment ever. Alas..The park was fairly empty until noon time. It was so weird to have the whole place to ourselves. It was also so weird to actually need to use a guide map! But we got so much done! Let's see...rides? My favorite was definitely Mystic Manor. In fact, I'd put it in my top 3 favorite Disney rides of all time. The ride is so technologically advanced and the theming details were all incredible. I also really enjoyed Space Mountain and Runaway Mine Cars. The Space Mountain here is a much smoother ride than the one at WDW. The Runaway Mine Cars was pretty thrilling too. Similar to Big Thunder Railroad in WDW but longer. Faster. With a twist!As for the shows? The Golden Mickey's was spectacular and I couldn't take my eyes off of the stage. The cast was wonderful and Bebe, the lead, was such a doll. Her voice gave me chills. As did Rafiki's from Festival of the Lion King. The show here is very different than the one at WDW, not as interactive, but more of a play by play. I enjoyed this very much though. My sister and I both felt that these shows were under appreciated though. The audience for both was so stoic and didn't seem to be having a good time. Cultural difference? I don't know. This kind of took away from the whole experience, especially when the cast is asking everyone to clap but get them from just from my sister and I and a select few others.

Disney does it best. Food    mostly asian options of course but quite a variety    Indian, Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, etc. Starliner Diner offered burgers and such too if you prefer. My sister and I had solid meals at Tahitian Terrace and Explorer's Club. We also decided to try as many HKDL specific snacks as we could stomach    curry popcorn, chocolate black sesame ice cream bars and korean dried squid. All were YUM. The fireworks were great but would have been so much better if not held behind the backdrop of a big ol' box. Arggh. The castle refurb was seriously such a letdown although honestly the only one. Some differences to WDW    It was definitely very different hearing the characters speak in Cantonese and Mandarin but it was cute. Park crowds were pretty light on both days. Instead of pins, everyone seems to collect stickers here. The cast members with the red pouches have them, fyi! Umm, the attention to detail between lands is a little lackluster. There was a lot of open blank spaces. Eeh. The cast members also don't look as happy.

Getting back was a bit more difficult, since we left with the hordes of other people leaving right after the fireworks show that begins as the park closes. (The show was great, for what it's worth.)We went on a Tuesday, and there weren't many crowds or long lines. The park actually felt oddly empty. Then again, we were there on a holiday (Dragon Boat Festival), which may have kept a lot of people away, so take that with a grain of salt.""","A one day pass for HK Disney costs around $100 per person but it is not worth the cost. It is smaller compared to Disney World or Disneyland and does not have many classic rides. However, it has some exclusive rides like Mystic Manor, which is highly recommended. There is a good amount of exclusive merchandise for Disney fanatics. The food is fancier but more expensive. The MTR was easy to get there but getting back was difficult due to the crowds. The park was not crowded on the day they visited, possibly due to a holiday."
United States,1,"It was a lot smaller, less crowded and also a lot less expensive then both US Disney's. It was a nice park, laid out well and although I'm not a big theme park fan, we had two very nice days here.

The performances were all big production numbers   get your tickets early in the day to avoid being shut out. You can easily do the park in one day if stretched for time (at least during off peak times) but we did two days, took a very relaxed pace and did multiple rides for all attractions.

United States,1,"My husband and I scheduled a trip to HK with no prior plans set. When he suggested going to Disney I was so excited! I have never been to Disney so this was a chance to check that off my bucket list. We preordered tickets through an app for a small discount. This allowed us to go in without queue (which seemed short anyway). It was the weekend prior to Halloween so the parade was villain themed (7pm). You'll want to get there early for a good seat. At 8pm there are fireworks over the castle, so stick around. We mostly went for the rides so I can't really comment on the characters as previous people have. We did enjoy the rides and this time of year the queues are quite short. I think 30mins was our longest queue but most were only 5 10mins. I recommend sticking around after the parade and riding a few more rides. Don't leave right then as half the park does, so transportation must be hell then. We left 40mins later and it was a breeze (ps  ride the runaway cars in the dark!) I also recommend downloading the HK Disney app. It gives you a map and the wait time of all rides in real time. Food: We did eat burgers at the park. While expensive I would say it was average price for an amusement park. Both ours were tasty. We also got popcorn for the parade and that was really good!

United States,1,"Having traveled to all the Disney parks in the world, I would have to say this was the smallest.

We purchased our tickets onsite and used the online 10% discount for foreign travelers just by showing the web page and our drivers licenses. Much easier than buying online.

I also got there shortly after they opened on a Monday, so it was not super busy which was great. It cost about $70 USD, and if I had been there all day, it would have been a fair value. There were a couple restaurants closed and a couple rides closed, that's why I gave it 4 stars. The rides I decided to go on, I had a mere 5 minute wait, which was great, no need for the Express Pass! Most of the princesses characters had no more then 15 minutes wait time, some I were able to just walk up to and get a photo that quick!! The longest line was at opening for photos with Holiday Mickey and Minnie  I would guess it would have been about an hour. For those who have been to DisneyWorld  the main Castle here is Sleeping Beauty's, so it's MUCH smaller. Also, TomorrowLand is MUCH smaller as well.

United States,1,"I loved, loved, loved Hong Kong Disneyland. Is it better than Anaheim? Of course not, don't be silly. But it was fun comparing the differences and similarities. Just a few tips:  If you are near any MTR stop, getting to the park is easy. The very last transfer is aboard a Disney car, and I loved the little Disney touches on it.   We went on two days, a Saturday (after New Years, last day of their Christmas celebration, so naturally a big day) and on the following Monday. Even on the Saturday the park didn't start to feel crowded until early afternoon. We were able to walk right onto rides all morning, and on most of the day on Monday.  The only two rides that had Fast Passes were Space Mountain and, inconceivably, Winnie The Pooh. They freaking love Winnie The Pooh over here. So if you have kids, make sure you get to that one early. In the afternoons the lines there were longer than anything else we saw in the park.   The live shows were great.  The Golden Mickeys  and  Lion King  are both worth seeing.   The  Stitch  encounter is reminiscent of the one with Crush (the turtle from Finding Nemo) in Anaheim. The show I saw wasn't perhaps quite as successful, but with an international audience you are bound to get hit some language barriers. Still fun.   Mystic Manor is a different sort of take on the Haunted Mansion. The effects are great and it is a lot of fun.   We did the drawing class and drew Olaf. The class is only offered in Chinese, but by just following along we had no problems. I still can't believe how they can make it seem like I can draw things, cause I could never replicate that outside of those classes.   Really the only complaint I had was the food. Theme park food is always going to be expensive, and I know this is in Hong Kong. But the Anaheim park has at least a couple of decently priced options. Everything here is pretty expensive.

Highly recommended for Disney fans!","Simplify ""I loved, loved, loved Hong Kong Disneyland. Is it better than Anaheim? Of course not, don't be silly. But it was fun comparing the differences and similarities. Just a few tips:  If you are near any MTR stop, getting to the park is easy. The very last transfer is aboard a Disney car, and I loved the little Disney touches on it.   We went on two days, a Saturday (after New Years, last day of their Christmas celebration, so naturally a big day) and on the following Monday. Even on the Saturday the park didn't start to feel crowded until early afternoon. We were able to walk right onto rides all morning, and on most of the day on Monday.  The only two rides that had Fast Passes were Space Mountain and, inconceivably, Winnie The Pooh. They freaking love Winnie The Pooh over here. So if you have kids, make sure you get to that one early. In the afternoons the lines there were longer than anything else we saw in the park.   The live shows were great.  The Golden Mickeys  and  Lion King  are both worth seeing.   The  Stitch  encounter is reminiscent of the one with Crush (the turtle from Finding Nemo) in Anaheim. The show I saw wasn't perhaps quite as successful, but with an international audience you are bound to get hit some language barriers. Still fun.   Mystic Manor is a different sort of take on the Haunted Mansion. The effects are great and it is a lot of fun.   We did the drawing class and drew Olaf. The class is only offered in Chinese, but by just following along we had no problems. I still can't believe how they can make it seem like I can draw things, cause I could never replicate that outside of those classes.   Really the only complaint I had was the food.

United States,1,"Disneyland Hong Kong (a Thursday in June 2017) from the Royal Plaza Hotel in Mongkok was easy to get to by MTR (purchase an Octopus card). It was about a 35min ride. It was about $75 US dollars for 1day admission (tickets purchased at the park). The one day pass is enough to see most of the park. It was a very hot sticky day. I suggest a lot of sunscreen, dri fit clothes, a cooling towel, water, and an umbrella (especially its typhoon season and you never know when it will rain). It says online that a selfie stick is not allowed but we saw many with them. You can bring your own water, but no canned or glass bottles. There is security check. The staff or cast members as they are called, are not so friendly as SoCal Disney and Disneyworld Florida. They have  Western  bathrooms and they have seat covers and toilet paper (if you have ever been around China, you know why I mentioned this). They also take Visa charge cards. It is about a third of the size of Disneyland SoCal. We got there about 10:30am. The park is sectioned off similar to Disneyland SoCal, Tomorrowland, Fantasyland, Adventureland are a few familiar areas. The Disney Characters do not walk around the park. On Main Street, they have a couple of designated areas that they give guest picture opportunities. I don't blame them, who would want to walk around in that costume in weather such as Hong Kong. The Winnie the Pooh ride had a really long line, which is ironic because the Winnie the Pooh ride in California has the shortest line. We decided to skip this ride. Grizzly Gulch seems to be the most thrilling compared to the other rides. Mystic Manor was my favorite ride, but then again I'm not big on rollercoasters. Ironman was a good ride too. The lines for the other rides are not too long, about 30 minutes wait. The shows are great, especially Lion King (A C was heaven). The park seemed to get a little busier at around 5:30pm.

The park hours that day was 10 9pm) we didn't want to wait till after the ending parade then we would be with a large crowd on the MTR (watch out for pickpocketers). We had a good time.

United States,1,"At the end of our southeast Asia trip, a couple girlfriends and I decided to visit Disneyland for one of their birthdays during our stop in Hong Kong. We're from southern CA and have been to Disneyland there since we were little, so we were really curious what the Disneyland in China is like. First of all, it's a good amount cheaper than the one in CA, about US $50 compared to the $90 at home.. But the park in HK is also smaller. We actually made our visit on a day at the tail end of a typhoon (fluctuating between level 1 and 3) so they told us all of the outdoor attractions would be closed... Which is all the rides but three. I would have given the value a 1 or 2 if the weather hadn't cleared up which opened the rest of the rides, including the new Grizzly Gulch mining cars! The mining cars ride alone was worth the trip, with unexpecting turns and backwards riding. However, the  cultural  experience comes with the people, and it was quite a kick and funny experience in itself. For example, despite that there are fenced queues, just like at any other Disneyland or theme park, the concept of a line really does not exist here. I guess waiting your turn was not a rudimentary lesson in preschool or something. The second you're not paying attention people slip past you. Actually, even when you are paying attention, people push past you. Personal space is also lacking in the common courtesy area, haha. Once you finally got the hang of holding down the fort in line (entails holding onto the handrails on both sides) someone's fanny pack is against your butt while youre pushed so close to the person in front of you that you're eating his hair. What's funny is, this super anxious demeanor applies to children AND adults alike, which we found very humorous. The poor weather even made the park less crowded, yet we saw people running to get ahead at any opportunity that presented itself. We waited in a wide queue for the Lion King show, and when the rope was unhooked to allow people into the theater, we found ourselves among a stampede, literally, sprinting to the theater to get a seat. As miserable as this sounds, we actually found it very humorous and had several laughs about it. Secondly, when lights dim in the theater or the curtains are pulled at the beginning of a show, this is not taken to mean to be quiet but rather start talking about anything that is remotely interesting, even feel free to yell about what is particularly appealing to you. The second the shows started, everyone began talking louder than normal voices. We found this somewhat bizarre, but perhaps we are the weird ones for thinking to be quiet during the shows. Expect a LOT of oohing and ahhing during shows, to a point where it feels like you're missing something bc you really can't grasp what's worth the extravagant reaction. During Philar Magic, everyone was screaming like really screaming and trying to grab the 3D objects, and I mean everyone. It was probably the funniest part of our day because we really weren't prepared for it. Lastly, one of the cutest little girls had to go to the bathroom, in which her mother proceeded to remove her daughters pants, covered her as the daughter squatted and peed on the floor in the queue, and then took off her daughter's shoes to shake off the excess pee that got on them, a little of which was sprayed on me. It was so foul and disturbing and shocking that it was almost funny, but we werent the only ones that were grossed out by this. It really was the icing on our cultural experience. Overall however, the day was amazing, especially because all the rides had opened by the end of the day. The mining cars were so fun that we went on them twice, and Toy Story Land has great attractions and I'm jealous that the Disneyland in CA doesn't have a toy story land! The food was tasty and the crowds weren't bad. Space Mountain was really fun too. The addition of Grizzly Gulch land really up'd the ante for this park, it was so cool. I'd say it's definitely worth it to go, especially if you're a Disney fan. Just go with an open mind and brace the cultural experience because we loved it.","Simplify ""At the end of our southeast Asia trip, a couple girlfriends and I decided to visit Disneyland for one of their birthdays during our stop in Hong Kong.

The mining cars ride alone was worth the trip, with unexpecting turns and backwards riding. However, the  cultural  experience comes with the people, and it was quite a kick and funny experience in itself. For example, despite that there are fenced queues, just like at any other Disneyland or theme park, the concept of a line really does not exist here. I guess waiting your turn was not a rudimentary lesson in preschool or something. The second you're not paying attention people slip past you. Actually, even when you are paying attention, people push past you. Personal space is also lacking in the common courtesy area, haha. Once you finally got the hang of holding down the fort in line (entails holding onto the handrails on both sides) someone's fanny pack is against your butt while youre pushed so close to the person in front of you that you're eating his hair. What's funny is, this super anxious demeanor applies to children AND adults alike, which we found very humorous. The poor weather even made the park less crowded, yet we saw people running to get ahead at any opportunity that presented itself. We waited in a wide queue for the Lion King show, and when the rope was unhooked to allow people into the theater, we found ourselves among a stampede, literally, sprinting to the theater to get a seat. As miserable as this sounds, we actually found it very humorous and had several laughs about it. Secondly, when lights dim in the theater or the curtains are pulled at the beginning of a show, this is not taken to mean to be quiet but rather start talking about anything that is remotely interesting, even feel free to yell about what is particularly appealing to you. The second the shows started, everyone began talking louder than normal voices. We found this somewhat bizarre, but perhaps we are the weird ones for thinking to be quiet during the shows. Expect a LOT of oohing and ahhing during shows, to a point where it feels like you're missing something bc you really can't grasp what's worth the extravagant reaction. During Philar Magic, everyone was screaming like really screaming and trying to grab the 3D objects, and I mean everyone. It was probably the funniest part of our day because we really weren't prepared for it. Lastly, one of the cutest little girls had to go to the bathroom, in which her mother proceeded to remove her daughters pants, covered her as the daughter squatted and peed on the floor in the queue, and then took off her daughter's shoes to shake off the excess pee that got on them, a little of which was sprayed on me. It was so foul and disturbing and shocking that it was almost funny, but we werent the only ones that were grossed out by this. It really was the icing on our cultural experience. Overall however, the day was amazing, especially because all the rides had opened by the end of the day. The mining cars were so fun that we went on them twice, and Toy Story Land has great attractions and I'm jealous that the Disneyland in CA doesn't have a toy story land! The food was tasty and the crowds weren't bad. Space Mountain was really fun too. The addition of Grizzly Gulch land really up'd the ante for this park, it was so cool. I'd say it's definitely worth it to go, especially if you're a Disney fan. Just go with an open mind and brace the cultural experience because we loved it.""","The author and a few friends visited Disneyland in Hong Kong during their Southeast Asia trip. They found the park to be smaller and cheaper than the one in California. They visited during the tail end of a typhoon, which resulted in all outdoor attractions being closed except three. The weather cleared up, allowing them to ride the new Grizzly Gulch mining cars, which was the highlight of the day. The author found the cultural experience at the park unique, as there was a lack of personal space and the concept of waiting in line did not exist. People were talking loudly during shows and there was a lot of excitement during the performances. They also witnessed a mother changing her daughter's pants and shaking off the excess pee in the queue. Overall, the author thought the park was worth visiting and recommended going with an open mind."
United States,1,"While smaller than other Disney parks, this theme park does well to keep the standard high. The crowds were present, and the queues could be long, but not bad compared to what's encountered at other Disney parks worldwide. Best to arrive early in the morning to beat some of the queues. Read ahead on what the events are for the day and you can plan to see parades, shows, do photo ops with Mickey Minnie Elsa Anna. There was a Frozen themed village display, but the only way to get in was to queue up at the area itself within the park right when the whole park opens at 1000. Thus, check ahead and you might have a more meaningful experience, especially if bringing kids. It's pricey like all Disney parks, but a very good experience overall. A lot of shows events are in Cantonese with English subtitles displayed on screens.Best way to get in is via metro which stops at a station prior, then you board a Disney metro that goes one additional stop to Disney only. Very convenient. Better than paying for a cab bus.","Simplify ""While smaller than other Disney parks, this theme park does well to keep the standard high.

However, this is a hard review because there are some positives, but there are some big negatives to Hong Kong Disney.POSITIVESWait Times   If you go during the week and get there when the park opens (generally at 10:30 AM), you will have 10 minute waits or less for the first couple of hours in the park. We went on a Monday in October and waited 5 10 minutes for all the major rides until around 1:30 2:00 when the park started to get more crowded. Even then, our longest wait was 30 minutes which would be considered short wait times by Orlando standards.Unique Rides   Big Grizzley Mountain is a superb ride that combines the best of Expedition Everest and Big Thunder Mountain. There are two great surprises on this ride that make it stand out as one of the best coasters Disney has assembled. HyperSpace Mountain combines a Star Wars theme to its classic ride to make it more exciting the original. And the new Iron Man ride is outstanding as well. Lastly, Mystic Manor takes the trackless innovation of Tokyo Disney's Winnie the Pooh and creates a Haunted Mansion experience that's truly one of the best.Shows   There are some terrific shows at the park, namely: Festival of the Lion King and Mickey and the Wondrous Book. Great music, costuming and special effects.NEGATIVESSize   Hong Kong Disneyland is definitely small which means you can pretty much do all the attractions in a single day.

Rarely did we receive a smile. No Disney cheerfulness. No excitement whatsoever in any cast member we saw. It makes you realize how much of the Disney experience is wrapped up in the attitude of their cast members because it soured our taste of this park.Line Cutting   People must have cut in line on us a dozen times or more.

United States,1,"MTR in Hong Kong is very sufficient, we finally arrived to Disneyland resort station within 20 mins from Wanchai station.We have been to Disney world in Orlando, this is a small version of that. We started with space mountain ride, that was awesome, but little kid can get scared. Our most favorite one was Big Grizzly mountain, we had to get on this twice. The best part of this ride was the train stopped and went backward for about 200 meters, then fired toward with high speed and turned sideways. That was absolutely awesome. The only one thing I wish for this ride is fast pass.

United States,1,"We were traveling to Hong Kong with our children and knew we needed to do a day at Hong Kong Disneyland. The park is rather small so a day is plenty of time. The lines to the rides were 10 minutes or less and the crowds were not overwhelming. Drawbacks, although it was Disney, I felt like it was Disney at 50% effort. It was Halloween and I have been to many other parks at this time and the decorations are amazing. Hong Kong Disney had Halloween decor up, but it seemed to be the leftovers from the other parks. It was not the same feeling you get in LA, or Orlando. I am glad we went, but definitely ok with going one time in my life. Side note, the weather was miserable.

Rides had short lines and crowds were manageable. The decorations for Halloween were present but not as impressive as other Disney parks. We were happy we went but wouldn't go again. The weather was hot and humid but the short ride lines were a plus.
United States,1," This Disneyland is much smaller than one in Los Angeles but nevertheless fun. The rides are different and creative. Highly recommend to come during a weekday and avoid possible wait. We came on a Tuesday, and the longest wait we had was 30 minutes most rides had a waiting time of 5 10 minutes. Check out the Mystic mansion ride, which shares a similar concept of the haunted mansion in the LA park but with a twist (more fun). It is my fav ride. Toy Story Land has a thrill ride called the RC rider, and it is U shaped coaster (not like a coaster but like the traditional pirate boat ride on a rail). For younger children, Pooh's house is a fun ride to check out! Do note that in May 2016, the Space Maintain is closed, and the Grizzly Mine car was on a two day maintenance when we visited on May 31st. Many Disneyland character showed up during our visit, and families and children can take pictures with them with ones' own phone or have professional picture taken. Food is expensive in general. Though about the same price as in LA Disneyland, they are still expensive overall   about HK $135 (~  US $20) a set of meal, HK $35 50 a snack (Micky shaped ice cream is HK $35), and HK $35 a bottle of water or soda. A key chain goes between HK $65 $135 depending on the material (plastic vs metal vs stuffed animal) and quality. Disneyland cookies and chocolate goes between HK $80 $198 depending on the flavor and quantity. A box of 16 butter cookies costs HK $88 but a box of mixed flavor cookies in an anniversary souvenir box goes up to HK $198.

United States,1,"Hong Kong Disneyland is different form the other Disney parks in that it's much smaller and less crowded. It basically a mini park if compared to the Florida parks. A few nice rides, such as a parachute ride and it's a small world but you can really see the whole park in one day. Short lines at the rides also makes the park easy to do. The park is at the end of a short subway train ride after changing trains from Hong Kong. It's also a 20 minute tide from the airport. We stayed at the disney hotel so we took the Disney bus to the park. But if you stay in Hong Kong itself it's not hard to get to the park by train. If you have the time I would surely take a train out to the park to enjoy a day at Disney.
